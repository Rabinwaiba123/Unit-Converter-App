 ## Hands-On Project: Unit Converter App
 This simple app will allow users to convert between
 different units of measurement, such as length, weight, and temperature. By the end of
 this project, you’ll have a deeper understanding of how to use methods, loops,
 conditionals, and user input in Java.
 
 ## What Will the App Do?
 The Unit Converter app will allow the user to:
 - Convert distances (e.g., kilometers to miles).
 - Convert weights (e.g., kilograms to pounds).
 - Convert temperatures (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).

We’ll focus on a console-based version of the app, but the structure can be extended into a GUI-based app in the future.
